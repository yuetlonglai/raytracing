Instruction to the code:

raytracer.py contains class Ray 
opticalelement.py contains class OpticalElement
refracting_surfaces.py contains class SphericalRefraction
outputplane.py contains class OutputPlane

the above mentioned are the classes required to make the system works
beambundle.py contains class beam:
class beam is a class that is created to facilitate shining a beam of parallel rays towards the lens

raytest.py is the script used to test before investigation and to generate a few plots to demonstrates that it works

ray_main.py would be the scripts that runs the programme for the investigation and plot the remaining figures needed for the report

*** ->> run raytest.py and ray_main.py to obtain the figures attached in the summary report <<- *** 
ray_main.py might take awhile to generate all the plots so be patient!! sorry for the inconvenience.
